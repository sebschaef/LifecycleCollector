# LifecycleCollector
This library provides you convenience extension functions to easier collect Kotlin Flows
lifecycle-aware from an Android component, such as Activity or Fragments. It gives you a
more convenient way to collect Flows in LiveData-fashion.

## Examples
```kotlin
class MainActivity : AppCompatActivity() {

    override fun onCreate() {
        ...
        viewModel.someStateFlow.collectWhenStarted(owner = this) {
            binding.someTextView.text = it
        }
    }
}
```
```kotlin
viewModel.someFlow.collectWhenResumed(owner = viewLifecycleOwner) {
    Log.d("Collected item:", it)
}
```
Note: To recreate the same behaviour as with LiveData, use `collectWhenStarted()`.

## Setup
```groovy
allprojects {
    repositories {
        ...
        maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
    }
}
```
```groovy
dependencies {
    implementation 'com.github.sebschaef:LifecycleCollector:0.2.2'
}
```

## How it works
It uses currently the experimental `androidx.lifecycle:lifecycle-runtime-ktx` under the hood, which
supports the `repeatOnLifecycle()` functionality to restart a flow collection after it left the
wanted lifecycle scope and re-enters it.

The convenience functions are no suspend functions and will handle the launch of a Coroutine
themselves. They will launch it in the `lifecycleScope` of the current `LifecycleOwner` and only
collect the given flow inside the specific scope (`CREATED`, `STARTED`, `RESUMED`). When the scope
is left, the collection is canceled. If the `LifecycleOwner` re-enters the scope, the collection is
restarted.
